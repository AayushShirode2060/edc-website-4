                        The World is moving to an era of modernization with the change in lifestyle.  Implementation of artificial intelligence in industries is making a big difference in today’s market. It has been creating a huge opportunity typically for entrepreneurs that come up with an AI start up. AI, Artificial intelligence is defined as:<br><br>
                        "The development of computer systems being able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual identification, speech recognition, decision making and translation of languages."

                <p>
                    The concept of AI was 1st noted during the Second World War by a British scientist, Alan Turning, who used it to crack German codes. After that, AI in particular became very popular. Lots of funds were raised for AI. In the early 70's the agencies which funded AI cut off their deals, due to slow results. The comeback was made when ‘the fifth generation project' by Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry was setup, in late 80's. After that, AI faced a lot of ups and downs, but in the due course adjusted with the stream. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    AI has grown to be a very challenging source of resource since the last decade. Importance of AI has increased in various sectors of business and technology. From the giants of Silicon Valley to the newly emerging start ups, everyone has a keen focus on AI. AI is appealing to every sector i.e. banking, software, technical, pharmaceuticals and even medical science. AI start ups will be at the mark of heck in the 21st century, creating a big opportunity for the struggling entrepreneurs to raise themselves exponentially in terms of growth and finance. 
                <p>
                   
                    We are living in the generation full of technology. Gone are those days when everyday tasks are performed manually. With the backbone of AI, every repeated task will be performed by machines, without human efforts. In such a way human efforts will be minimized and work efficiency will be maximized, gaining profits.<br>
                    <br>Today AI is great help for human in various sectors. 

                </p>
                <p>
                <h3>Banking and finance</h3>
                The main role of AI in mobile banking domain is to improve the customer service. After gathering the data from the user's mobile devices, the AI-based mobile banking application processes the data through machine learning to provide the relevant information or redirecting the users to a source of information. Coming together of banking and sectors like IT, telecom and retail has increased the transfer of critical information over virtual networks that are vulnerable to cyber-attacks and fraudulence. These incidents not only affect the profitability of banks, but also hamper banks’ trust and relationship with customers. Hence AI has been added to the security functioning of the bank accounts of users as well.

				</p> -->
                
                <h3>Medical science</h3>
                <p>
                 
                The primary aim of health and medical related AI applications is to analyze relationships between prevention or treatment techniques and patient outcomes. AI programs have been developed and applied to practices such as diagnosis processes, treatment protocol development, drug development, personalized medicine, and patient monitoring and care. The work of creating an independent medical system is successfully achieved using AI. 

                </p>
                <h3>IT</h3>
                <p>
                 
                    Since the IT sector is all about computers, software, and other data transmissions, there is a relatively important role Artificial Intelligence can play in this domain.
                    It is used in data security for different IT companies. Artificial Intelligence uses a series of algorithms, which can be applied directly to aid programmers when it comes to writing better code and overcoming software bugs.<br><br>
                    Through the use of deep learning applications, organizations can go a long way in automating back-end processes, which help enable cost savings and reduce human intervention. AI enabled methods improve over time as the algorithms adjust to enhance productivity and learn from mistakes.
                </p>
                <h3>Education </h3>
                <p>
                 
                AI will be included in education in near future and almost all the classrooms worldwide will enjoy its benefits. Better visual understanding can be done through 3D models shown  to students with the help of AI. Anybody can study from any corner of the world using this technology. Reduced human errors will guarantee efficient education and will mentor a child in a more professional manner. Almost all the subjects will be easily explained through different software using AI.
                </p>
                <h3>Business/Start-ups</h3>
                <p>
                    The importance of AI has tremendously grown over the decade in business and start-ups. There are many emerging start-ups related to artificial intelligence . Even after the business has been set ,adding AI to its internal functioning is very beneficial and has been seen to increase the value of the company.
                    Artificial intelligence in businesses can be used to:<br>
                    Increase competitive advantage and improve efficiency, advance automated interactions with customers and workers, multiply productivity gains by automating processes, power smarter machinery, vehicles and structures and enhance customer intimacy and thereby increase consumer demand.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Due to such drastic technological advancement, there can be a problem of unemployment.
                    In the upcoming years skilled labour will surely have a lot of importance in the market and sustain better. Artificial Intelligence has helped developers broaden their horizons and carry out operations which were otherwise considered impossible. Developers have seen a rapid change in software development, architectural planning, and even driving quality assurance; this automation has further led to the useful enhancement of application development, making it an instant hit with developers and organizations at large. The effects of AI will be magnified in the coming decade, as virtually every industry will transform their core processes and business models to take advantage of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The bottleneck now is in business imagination, implementation, and management. For business leaders, it is imperative to get a plan for making AI work in the organization. Initial AI projects may get delayed or under deliver, but the risk of businesses becoming non-competitive by ignoring AI is high.
