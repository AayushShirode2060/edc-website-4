                                                                   <br>
                                                                   The U.S. manufacturer’s forecast is slightly higher than the one it made in December 2018, when it said India would require 2,300 new aircraft for $320 billion over 20 years. At a briefing in New Delhi on Wednesday, Boeing’s deputy vice president of commercial marketing Darren Hulst said first deliveries of the 777X are planned in the next 18 months.
                                                                        Hulst also said Boeing is working closely with regulators to get the 737 Max back into operation in the U.S. this quarter and then elsewhere depending on regulatory approvals. The previously best-selling jet has been grounded globally since mid-March following deadly crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia.
                                                                        <br>

Still, air-travel penetration remains low in the nation of 1.3 billion, encouraging airlines to expand rapidly. This sets up a huge advantage to the Indian air system as they have another chance to put a step back in furthering the Indian economy. The news of Jet Airways this year was surely a let down by the air system and they can surely gather and boost up their system and grow in the next decade to become one of the top air industries in the world says experts.</li>

                     Top Indian airline IndiGo said on Thursday it signed a one-way codeshare agreement with Qatar Airways, letting the Middle Eastern airline get more access to the fast-growing Indian market. That was a really onset deal made by the airline giants and businesses were really on the verge of questioning.
                                                                               <br>
                                                                               The agreement will enable Qatar Airways to place its code on IndiGo flights between Doha and Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad, the companies said.
                                                                               IndiGo, owned by Interglobal Aviation has about 40% share of the domestic market and operates a large fleet of narrow body aircraft.
                                                                               <br>
                                            The deal comes at a time when IndiGo's two co-founders, Rakesh Gangwal and Rahul Bhatia, have been put up in a dispute about corporate governance of the airline, sparking concern among investors it could have an impact on the airline's valuation and strategy.
The airline had once shunned codeshare deals to help keep costs low in line with its budget carrier model but changed its strategy altogether to stay in the growing market.
The market evaluation due to this deal was seen to increase in the following time and hence has proved to be a boon for these airline companies.

            Endorsing the estimates of Rs 2,000 notes shrinking in circulation, former department of economic affairs secretary SC Garg has said that the high-value notes can be demonetised without causing any disruption.
<br>
            He claimed that the Rs 2,000 notes may not have been in circulation much now as they have been hoarded by people. The reason being is hardly anyone wants to offer 2000 rupees notes for change. And most of it is not circulating in the economy rather just being stagnant in the country.
<br>
            "A good chunk of Rs 2,000 notes are actually not in circulation, having been hoarded. The Rs 2000 note, therefore, is not presently working as a currency of transaction," Garg explained.
<br>
            "A simple method, depositing these notes in the bank accounts can be used in managing the process," the former bureaucrat said in a 72-page policy prescription for India to become $10 trillion by 2030.
<br>
            This will enable a smooth process for the notes to be cut down and everyone will have their demands satisfied.
<br>
            The former bureaucrat also said that they will surely see a replacement for this change by some other currency note, so possibly adding on to the addition of a new currency note soon.

    Barsys, the inventors of the $1,000 robot bartender, have created a sleek and an amazing $149 saucer that helps you make perfect cocktails at home.  The Barsys Coaster is a smart device that’s supposed to take the guesswork out of how much to pour: all you have to do is place your glass on the coaster, pair it to the app, and start pouring. That’s it so simple. Make yourself a cocktail you want to have automatically with this device.
<br>
    This app will explain what you need, and the coaster will light up when you should finish pouring. “With the Coaster, we set out to make serving a cocktail as easy as grabbing a beer or pouring a glass of wine,” wrote Barsys founder and CEO Akshet Tewari in a press release. “Cocktail-making requires a level of skill and precision that anyone can now obtain.”
With this new device the CEO is pretty sure that you wouldn't be sad with what it offers. You don't need a personalized bar tender. Nor do you actually need to go to the bar, just sit home and enjoy the extravaganza of something special!

        China and the United States have agreed to cancel in phases the tariffs imposed during their months-long trade war, the Chinese commerce ministry said on Thursday, without specifying a timetable.
<br>
        An interim US-China trade deal is widely expected to include a US pledge to scrap tariffs scheduled for December 15 on about $156 billion worth of Chinese imports, including cell phones, laptop computers and toys.
<br>
        Tariff cancellation was an important condition for any agreement, ministry spokesman Gao Feng said, adding that both must simultaneously cancel some tariffs on each other’s goods to reach a “phase one” trade deal.
<br>
        The trade war started with tariffs, and should end with the cancellation of tariffs,” Gao told a regular news briefing.
<br>
        The proportion of tariffs cancelled for both sides to reach a “phase one” deal must be the same, but the number to be cancelled can be negotiated, he added, without elaborating.

            Infosys Chairman Nandan Nilekani said that even God can't change the earnings of the company. He was responding to whistle-blowers’ plaint that have made a series of allegations against CEO Salil Parekh and CFO Nilanjan Roy.
            <br>
            Addressing analysts in a conference call, Nilekani said he felt "insulted with the (whistle-blowers) accusations.” But said he does not want to bias the investigation.
           <br>
            He said that the company had become aware of the complaint on September 30 and it was placed before the audit committee on October 10 due to the various allegations imposed on them.
            A group of Infosys staffers calling themselves ‘ethical employees’ wrote to the Infosys’ board and to the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) in September about the accounting irregularities. In addition to writing to the company, the whistle-blowers say they have presented evidence to the US Securities and Exchange Commission in the form of recordings and emails. This was, however, not shared with the firm.

                After keeping its top India position vacant for eight months, Google has appointed Sanjay Gupta as its new country manager and vice president of sales and operations. The top India position was vacant for 8 months from Google and finally Gupta was appointed the position succeeding Rajan Anandan, who left Google to join Sequoia Capital India as its managing director.
                <br>
                Gupta served as a managing director at Disney India and Star (which Disney now owns) before joining the Android -maker. He helped Star make a major push in the digital consumers business through video streaming service Hotstar, where he aggressively worked on partnerships and licensing for cricket rights and other content.
                <br>
                Now he has great responsibilities ahead of him and his aspects are great in terms of future representations and conquering the market world.

                    Kepler delivers 120 Mbps uplink to Arctic via satellite broadband. Kepler Communications has claimed a first in the Arctic, successfully delivering more than 100 Mbps broadband connectivity via its nanosatellite network to scientists taking part in a massive research expedition in the region.
                    <br>
                    Toronto-based Kepler on Thursday demonstrated data rates of 38 Mbps downlink and 120 Mbps uplink on the German icebreaker Polar stern to a 2.4m Ku-band. Every ship is home to the international Mosaic expedition that involves hundreds of scientists and operations crews examining the effects of climate change on the Arctic.

                    It was a great news as so much speed at such heights and extremes of the globe was never made possible before.
                    <br>
                    If such places can have such high speeds of data it is quite helpful to have such speeds at other corners of the globe too for various other reasons.
                    <br>
                    Scientists are looking forward to gather as much predictions from the data and work more due to the easiness made available to them by the connection speeds
