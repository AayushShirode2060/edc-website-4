								The past decade has seen a transition of start-ups from being product-based to service-based. The product based

								Consequently, there has been a rise in the demand for human resources. As, before there were more of product
								based startups, physical assets like plants, machinery, etc. were of utmost importance. In contrast, now as the
								shift has been towards service based, the knowledge and attitude of the employees have gained more importance.
								Human resources have truly proven to important for the company as it is solely responsible for the effective
								utilization of all the physical as well as financial resources. Better the quality of human resources of a
								company better would be its management and utilization of its resources. Hence, human resources contribute to
								the overall net worth of the company. Some companies fail to manage their human resources efficiently through
								conventional accounting methods which results in the new position called Human Resources Accounting.

							Try recalling the frustrating times you would have to stand in a queue just to get a movie ticket and ended up
							seeing it go houseful in front of your eyes. Who would have thought one could be booking tickets through their
							phones, just sitting at home? Well, gone are the days when we had to stand in queues for long hours just to book
							a ticket. Booking a ticket has been simplified to a whole different level. It is now just a few clicks away. All
							this is possible due to the ever-developing technology and the mastermind behind this concept, Ashish
							Hemranjini.
