                                        Rumoured  for the past several years Google's entry into gaming was made official this March. Came up with  new launch named stadia which was slowly detailed over the next eight months and its officially launching for the first gamers in 14 countries.
                                        <br>
                                        Stadia is a game streaming service that allows Google'a vast cloud infrastructure to deliver titles over the web without any need or specialised hardware. This is an ambitious effort that follows in the footsteps of the company's other large platforms like Chrome and  Android. 
                                        Google hopes to bring this form of entertainment to the next billion gamers by eradication of limitations that certainly exist today. Besides desktops it is available on televisions and mobile devices too. So for most gamers they can stream their games on large screens which they really wanted to do since the beginning. Playing high end games on the Internet was always a dream for many gamers out there and Google making that possible is really making them a step ahead in the gaming industry. Gaming industry has flourished greatly in the past

                                    Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel lost over 49 lakh users in September this year, while their rival Reliance Jio added 69.83 lakh new users to its network, as per data from  TRAI.
                                    These two have been in the competition since this decade and have a lot of points which separates themselves from the rest.
                                    
                            <br>
                            Since now Reliance Jio has added a small hike for calling and extra data charges a fall in the sales has been observed. Though it isn't a huge amount when compared to the losses of airtel and idea.
                            <br>
                            After the merger of Vodafone and Idea there was a sustainable growth in the company. But unfortunately they couldn't survive in the ever growing telecommunication market.
                            As per the data bharti airtel lost 23.8 lakh users since September to take its total user base to 32.55 crore. Similarly Vodafone idea lost 25.7 lakh users in the month to take his total user base to 37.24 Crore. Whereas reliance jio has been adding users in September taking its total user-base tp 35.52 crore.
                            <br>
                            The wireless service has been increased at the end of September and a hope of rise in yhe market share has been predicted.

                                            A group of secondary school students in the Philippines have found a way to convert poop of stray dogs into a mixture for bricks.
                                            <br>
                                            It lowers construction costs as promised by the students also cleaning the streets as well.
                                            As part of a research project 8th graders in the Payatas district north of the capital Manila gathered  dog faeces which were then mixed with cement powder and molded into rectangular bio bricks.
                                            <br>
                                            Local government and corporation would sponcer the students to help them upgrade the production.
                                            Dog ownership in Philippines is not regulated and rules of taking care of pets is not well done. Hence the students here are solving a huge problem faced by the people in Philippines. Each brick produced contain 10 gram of dog poop and 10grams of cement powder and doesn't have a bad odour at all !.
