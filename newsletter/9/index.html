            <h3>
                <i>INTRODUCTION </i>
            </h3>
            <br>
            <p>Since decades Indian students have been enamoured by the international universities. New experiences, new
                vistas, new
                horizons - attract the young Indian boys and girls, year after year.
             <br>   <br> <b> THE CHALLENGES</b><br>
                Despite seismic shifts in diplomatic relations between nations and stricter immigration laws, the allure
                of
                international education remains strong for Indian students. Even after enduring the chaos brought on by
                the COVID-19
                bans, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the diplomatic deadlock with Canada, earning a degree
                from a foreign
                university is worthwhile.
                <br><br>
                <i> The number dynamics</i><br>
                Based on University Living's survey Beyond Beds and Boundaries: Indian Student Mobility Report 2023, the
                number of
                Indian students studying overseas is predicted to reach two million by 2025, up from about a million in
                2019.
                Additionally, it was discovered that Indian students directly spent $47 billion on their education
                abroad in 2022, and
                that amount is predicted to increase to as much as $70 billion by 2025.
                <br><br>
                <i> Changing rules</i><br>
                India's market for international education primarily targets the United States, Canada, Australia, New
                Zealand and the
                United Kingdom. These nations modified their regulations this year in an effort to expedite the
                application procedure.
                The United States imposed rigorous checks and penalties on dishonest universities. Depending on the
                application
                location, there is a waiting period of 100-325 days for student visas in India. The United Kingdom will
                only grant
                dependent visas to foreign students pursuing postgraduate research degrees starting in January 2024,
                which caused a
                last-minute rush among this year's visa seekers. Numerous students have decided to postpone their
                applications from
                January to September as a result of Canada's diplomatic deadlock with India.

                </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    Indian students consistently enroll in postgraduate management courses and undergraduate STEM
                    (science, technology,
                    engineering, and math) degrees.
                    <br>
                    International degrees not only help students expand their knowledge at their own pace and get out of
                    their comfort
                    zones, but they also give them an advantage in the job market in India. A growing number of
                    countries are collaborating
                    with foreign institutions to address the labor shortages in their markets. Although the programs are
                    still being
                    developed, the majority of the growth at the undergraduate level appears to be concentrated on AI,
                    blockchain, cyber
                    security, and data science for the upcoming year.
                    <br><br>
                    <i> Role of a trusted consultant</i><br>
                    Indian students living in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities can now consult with consultants who provide
                    advice on developing a
                    unique personal brand for international university applications. A growing number of Indian students
                    are applying
                    overseas as a result of consultants' assistance with financial aid and scholarship applications.
                    Improving transparency
                    <br><br>
                    Consultancies are using AI and digitalization to counteract the long-standing perception that
                    student visas serve as a
                    backdoor for illegal immigration. Their quality control teams examine the financial stability of
                    applicants. Via the
                    channels, the applicant can also track the status of their documents. Transparency is key to the
                    sector's success.

                <br>
                <p>
                    Once upon a time, in the world of marketing, CGI stepped onto the stage, offering brands a
                    magical path to captivating their audiences:
                <p><br>
                    <b> 1) Cost-Efficiency with CGI: </b> In the world of commercial marketing, CGI offers a
                    cost-effective alternative to traditional photography and videography. It eliminates the need
                    for expensive crews and reduces transportation expenses and logistics hassles.
                </p>
                <p><br>
                    <b>2) Maximizing Audience Impact: </b> The essence of any successful commercial marketing
                    campaign is leaving a lasting impression on the audience. CGI achieves this by creating wonder
                    and enhancing the overall viewing experience, ensuring a stronger connection with customers.
                </p>
                <p><br>
                    <b>3) Visualizing Products in Advance:</b> When your product isn't ready for a photoshoot, CGI
                    comes to the rescue. It allows you to visualize prototypes and products well before their
                    official launch.
                </p>
                <p><br>
                <h3><i>CONCLUSION</i></h3>
                With the help of CGI, you will be able to create your products from scratch, even if they have not
                made it beyond your research and development centres.
