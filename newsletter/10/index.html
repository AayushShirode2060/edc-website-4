                    <b> 1) Cost-Efficiency with CGI: </b> In the world of commercial marketing, CGI offers a
                    cost-effective alternative to traditional photography and videography. It eliminates the need
                    for expensive crews and reduces transportation expenses and logistics hassles.

                    campaign is leaving a lasting impression on the audience. CGI achieves this by creating wonder
                    and enhancing the overall viewing experience, ensuring a stronger connection with customers.

                    <b>3) Visualizing Products in Advance:</b> When your product isn't ready for a photoshoot, CGI
                    comes to the rescue. It allows you to visualize prototypes and products well before their
                    official launch.

                <h3><i>CONCLUSION</i></h3>
                With the help of CGI, you will be able to create your products from scratch, even if they have not
                made it beyond your research and development centres.
